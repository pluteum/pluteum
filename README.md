This is the monorepo for all of the services that run Pluteum, an ebook library.

Pluteum is currently pre-alpha, please visit [pluteum.io](https://pluteum.io) if you're interested in hearing about when Pluteum is usable!

If you're interested in contributing, please reach out to me, I'd l(ove to spend some time going over where we're at and the plan for the future. I can be reached at [gsumpster@gmail.com](mailto:gsumpster@gmail.com)
